# *Python_Project: Web-Scraping with Python*

This repository contains a web scraping project that collects data from [List of largest companies in Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_Canada). The primary focus of this project is to create and export a CSV file based on the information available on a web page and generate informative charts using Python and its libraries.

## *About the Project*
The objective of this project is to scrape data from website, analyze it for legal implications, generate insightful charts, and save the results in CSV files for further analysis. It is essential to respect the legal constraints and terms of service of the websites being scraped to ensure ethical and responsible data collection.

## *Legal Impacts*
When conducting web scraping, it is crucial to consider the legal implications and adhere to ethical guidelines. Make sure to:

- Review the terms of service and robots.txt file of the websites you are scraping.
- Respect any copyrights, trademarks, or intellectual property rights.
- Avoid overloading the target website with requests to prevent denial of service.
- Always ensure that your web scraping activities comply with relevant laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.

## *Getting Started*
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

## *Data Analysis*
The collected data is analyzed to generate insightful charts and visualizations. Data analysis tools and techniques used in this project include:

- Visualization using different libraries: Pandas, BeatifulSoup, Matplotlib, Numpy and Seaborn.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.


## *Results*
The results of the web scraping and data analysis are presented in the following:

### [Google Colaboratory Notebook:](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SGULtSjdpXjII-JdNGPaSjBJWXcehxa1?usp=drive_link): This notebook contains all the Python code necessary to develop this project, including how web scraping was achieved and the step-by-step guide to creating a [*CSV file*](https://github.com/Felipegg2/Python_Project/blob/main/largest%20companies%20in%20Canada.csv). Note: You can find the CSV file generated through web scraping in this repository.

### Four charts developed with Matplotlib:

Bar Chart: Shows the top 10 companies with the highest revenue.
